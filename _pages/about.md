Reeve Williams has been working for over ten years on his designs.  He specializes in converting any image into a black and white stencil representation on either clear glass, a glass mirror, or Plexiglas.  He has recreated iconic images as well as custom images for friends and family.  The sizes of the works range from about one foot tall (hand held) to about five feet tall.  He also uses reclaimed and found materials, such as glass coffee tables.

Reeve currently lives in Tacoma, Washington, with his family.
